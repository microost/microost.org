<h1><code>import org.microost.*;</code></h1>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://microost.org">microost.org</a>&quot; is an Internet domain name for package names of open-sourced Java libraries.</p>
<p>When publishing a new small open-sourced Java library as a person, naming its Java package is a problem. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.1-220">Internet domain names are used for Java packages</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone does not have their own personal domain name. Even if they have, personal domain names may not be the best solution as their lifetimes depend.</li>
<li>Domain names of source code hosting services (such as <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and <a href="https://sf.net/">sf.net</a>) are not always the best solution also due to their lifetimes.</li>
<li>Purchasing a new domain name for each library is not very reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://microost.org">microost.org</a>&quot; intends to be a co-managed hosting of a Java package namespace in the future. It is managed by <a href="https://github.com/dmikurube">a person</a> for the time being, though.</p>
<h1>Q &amp; A</h1>
<h2>What is &quot;microost.org&quot; for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is only for providing a Java package namespace to reserve.
</ul>
<h2>What is NOT &quot;microost.org&quot; for?</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting source code.
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting library packages.
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting web pages.
</ul>
<h2>Is &quot;microost.org&quot; to be maintained farther into the future?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, not guaranteed... <a href="https://github.com/dmikurube">The owner</a> may retire, may be bored, or may give up. Assume that it is <strong>still</strong> a personal domain name which is just accepting requests. Co-owners may help the situation!</p>
<p>Even if gave up, the owner would try calling for successors as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Can I get to an co-owner?</h2>
<p>Co-owners are not publicly called for at the moment.</p>
<h2>How is a new package name registered?</h2>
<p>Send a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/microost/microost.org">GitHub repository</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/microost/microost.org/blob/gh-pages/README.md">README.md</a> there. (TBA)</p>
<h2>Are all available registration requests unconditionally accepted?</h2>
<p>No, at least for the time being. The owner would review pull requests for a while.</p>
<h2>What does &quot;microost&quot; mean?</h2>
<p>&quot;microost&quot; is a coined word from &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee">microroast</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/roost">roost</a>&quot;.</p>
<h2>How is &quot;microost&quot; pronounced?</h2>
<p>Like mike-roost.</p>
<h2>Why the checker script written in Python, not Java?</h2>
<p>Sorry..., it was the quickest for the author initially. To be rewritten. :)</p>
