<h1>microost.org</h1>
<p>&quot;microost.org&quot; is an Internet domain name for package names of open-sourced Java libraries.</p>
<p>When publishing a new small open-sourced Java library as a person, naming its Java package is a problem. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.1-220">Internet domain names are used for Java packages</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone does not have their own personal domain name. Even if they have, using the personal domain name may not be the best solution as its lifetime may depend on the person.</li>
<li>Domain names of source code hosting services (such as <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket.org</a>) are not always the best solution also due to their lifetimes.</li>
<li>Purchasing a new domain name for each library is not very reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;microost.org&quot; intends to be a co-managed hosting of Java package namespace. It is managed by a person for the time being, though.</p>
