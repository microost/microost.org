<h1><code>import org.microost.*;</code></h1>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://microost.org">microost.org</a>&quot; is an Internet domain name for package names of open-sourced Java libraries.</p>
<p>When publishing a new small open-sourced Java library as a person, naming its Java package is a problem. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.1-220">Internet domain names are used for Java packages</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone does not have their own personal domain name. Even if they have, personal domain names may not be the best solution as their lifetimes depend.</li>
<li>Domain names of source code hosting services (such as <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and <a href="https://sf.net/">sf.net</a>) are not always the best solution also due to their lifetimes.</li>
<li>Purchasing a new domain name for each library is not very reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://microost.org">microost.org</a>&quot; intends to be a co-managed hosting of a Java package namespace in the future. It is yet owned/managed by <a href="https://github.com/dmikurube">a single person</a> for the time being, though.</p>
<h2><a name="for-maven-central-administrators">For Maven Central administrators</a></h2>
<p><strong>Please do not accept New Project requests with their Group ID is just <code>&quot;org.microost&quot;</code>, not <code>&quot;org.microost.something&quot;</code>!</strong></p>
<p>The domain name &quot;<a href="http://microost.org">microost.org</a>&quot; is not owned for a single project. Please consider <code>&quot;org.microost&quot;</code> like <code>&quot;com.github&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;io.github&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;net.sf&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Q &amp; A</h2>
<h3>What is &quot;microost.org&quot; for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is only for hosting a Java package namespace to reserve.
</ul>
<h3>What is NOT &quot;microost.org&quot; for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting subdomain names.
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting source code.
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting library packages.
<li>&quot;microost.org&quot; is NOT for hosting web pages.
</ul>
<h3>Is &quot;microost.org&quot; to be maintained farther into the future?</h3>
<p>Not guaranteed unfortunately. The owner may retire, may be bored, or may give up. Assume &quot;microost.org&quot; is <strong>still</strong> just a personal domain name which is accepting requests from others. Co-owners may help the situation!</p>
<p>Even if the owner gives up, will try calling for successors as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Can I join this project as a co-owner?</h3>
<p>Co-owners are not publicly called for at the moment. Ping me if you and I know each other.</p>
<h3>How can I register a new package name?</h3>
<p>Send a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/microost/microost.org">GitHub repository</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/microost/microost.org/blob/gh-pages/README.md">README.md</a> there.</p>
<h3>Are all valid registration requests unconditionally accepted?</h3>
<p>No, at least for the time being. The owner would review pull requests, and determine on their own.</p>
<h3>Can I register a package name for a person or an organization, not for a project?</h3>
<p>It is not completely prohibited, but the owner does not welcome such registrations.</p>
<h3>What does &quot;microost&quot; mean?</h3>
<p>&quot;microost&quot; is a coined word from &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee">microroast</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/roost">roost</a>&quot;.</p>
<h3>How is &quot;microost&quot; pronounced?</h3>
<p>Like mike-roost.</p>
<h3>Can I fork &quot;microost.org&quot; and host similar on a different domain name?</h3>
<p>No any problems! Feel free to host your own.</p>
<h3>Why the checker script written in Python, not Java?</h3>
<p>Sorry..., it was the quickest for the author initially. To be rewritten. :)</p>
